                Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to this agreement. &nbsp;However, the Arbitrator, and

                arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the cost of the arbitration from being
                prohibitive. &nbsp;In the final award, the arbitrator may apportion the costs of arbitration and the

                &nbsp;The arbitrator may not consolidate or join the claims of other persons or parties who may be
                similarly situated. &nbsp;The arbitrator may award in the arbitration the same damages or other relief
