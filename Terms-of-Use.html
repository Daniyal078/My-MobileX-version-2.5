                arbitrator. The arbitrator&rsquo;s decision in any such arbitration will be final and binding upon the

                local court or agency, shall have the exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the
                interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of this agreement including, but not limited

                arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the cost of the arbitration from being
                prohibitive. In the final award, the arbitrator may apportion the costs of arbitration and the
                compensation of the arbitrator among the parties in such amounts as the arbitrator deems appropriate.

                representative basis. The arbitrator can decide only your and/or our individual claims. The arbitrator
                may not consolidate or join the claims of other persons or parties who may be similarly situated. The
                arbitrator may award in the arbitration the same damages or other relief available under applicable law,

                a &ldquo;public injunction&rdquo; and any such &ldquo;public injunction&rdquo; may be awarded only by a
                federal or state court. If either party seeks a &ldquo;public injunction,&rdquo; all other claims and
                prayers for relief must be adjudicated in arbitration first and any prayer or claim for a &ldquo;public
                injunction&rdquo; in federal or state court stayed until the arbitration is completed, after which the
                federal or state court can adjudicate the party&rsquo;s claim or prayer for &ldquo;public injunctive

                preclusion by the decision of the arbitrator.</p>
